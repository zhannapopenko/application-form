# Application form

#### This project contains two pages of forms and one final page to report completion. 
#### Form validation is also implemented in the project.

### [Demo](https://zhannapopenko.github.io/application-form/)

### I've built this site using:
- HTML
- CSS/Less
- JavaScript
- [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) (to create a background)
- [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) (to create a Datepicker)
